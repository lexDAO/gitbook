# LexDAO Readme

## Introduction

In order that we might find a new way to manage existing work of the DAO and to start compiling simple markdown, we will be creating a Gitbook to act as a 
repository for projects, proposals, and committee documentation.  Over time this will continue to expand with contributions from the membership.

## Goals
To provide a central content repository for LexDAO that is:
+ safe from deletion
+ public and open source
+ more user friendly to non-coders
+ familiar to coders
+ indexable by search engines
+ tied directly to our Git environment
+ able to help enhance our governance process
+ able to be integrated into other applications
