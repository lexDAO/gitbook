# Grant Committee Purpose

### Why we are here?

The Grant Committee has been formed to assist in the day to day management of finding, winning, and allocating grant funding on behalf of LexDAO for the advancement of legal engineering, public goods, crypto-law advocacy, and the LexDAO Guild.

* We plan to help alleviate some of the administrative burden of the Operating Committee by helping manage incubator projects and priority initiatives within the DAO as well as the terms surrounding those projects.
* In helping steward these projects, we plan to work with the DAO Membership, Operating Committee, and those seeking funding to ensure the money LexDAO obtains through grants is effectively and responsibly allocated across LexDAO for projects best suited to the advancement of the guild.
